<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is a python based application build to learn name of Indian states. It is a Seterra like application. Currently the app only does limited thing but we can add cities or other national landmarks as well. Or even improve the UI.

Here's why:
* This project will help you to improve your basic understanding of Python development, using turtle and pandas etc. 
* It will also help you learn how to build an effective UI/UX for your own projects.
* The tech stack used is very beginner friendly.
* It will help you learn to develop python based interactive applications.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With
